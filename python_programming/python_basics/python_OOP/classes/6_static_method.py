"""
Use of Python static method:

We can use a static method for simple functionality that is mostly not related to the class.

static methods can't access class or instance state because they don't take a cls or self argument.

static method, we do not need the self or cls to be passed as the first argument.
Static methods do not have any knowledge related to the class that they are built-in.
Static method cannot alter or change any variable value or state of the class.

Most of the functionalities of the static methods can be performed using a class method. However, we prefer
the static method, at places where it could work to make our program more efficient and faster
as we do not have to pass self as a parameter, so the efficiency of the program increases.

# *******************************

# Class method vs Static Method
# The difference between the Class method and the static method is:

# A class method takes cls as the first parameter while a static method needs no specific parameters.
# A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method canâ€™t access or modify it.
# In general, static methods know nothing about the class state. They are utility-type methods that take some parameters and work upon those parameters. On the other hand class methods must have class as a parameter.
# We use @classmethod decorator in python to create a class method and we use @staticmethod decorator to create a static method in python.
# When to use the class or static method?
# We generally use the class method to create factory methods. Factory methods return class objects ( similar to a constructor ) for different use cases.
# We generally use static methods to create utility functions.
