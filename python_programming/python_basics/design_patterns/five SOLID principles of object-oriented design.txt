The SOLID principles are a set of five fundamental design principles in object-oriented programming and design.
They were introduced by Robert C. Martin as a guide to writing maintainable, scalable, and flexible software.
Each principle focuses on a specific aspect of software design and helps developers create clean, robust, and well-structured code.

*****************************

The five SOLID principles are as follows:

1) Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
A class should have only one reason to change, which means it should have only one responsibility or job.
 This principle promotes high cohesion, where each class is focused on performing a specific task.
 By keeping classes small and focused, it becomes easier to understand, maintain, and extend the code.

2) Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
In other words, you should be able to extend the behavior of a class without modifying its source code.
This is typically achieved through the use of inheritance, interfaces, and abstraction, which allow new functionalities to be added without altering existing code.

3) Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.
Inheritance relationships should maintain the expected behavior, and derived classes should not alter or violate the contracts defined by their base classes.

*************
4) Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
This principle suggests that you should create fine-grained interfaces tailored to the specific needs of the clients,
 rather than having a single large interface that covers all possible operations. This promotes a more flexible and cohesive design.


In simple words:
"Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use."

This principle suggests that when designing interfaces, it's better to create multiple small, specific interfaces
rather than having a single large interface that covers all possible operations.
Each interface should represent a specific set of related functionalities.

In other words:

i) A class or component should only be required to implement the methods that are relevant to its specific functionality.
ii) Clients (classes that use the interface) should not be burdened with implementing methods they don't need.
By following the Interface Segregation Principle, you achieve a more flexible and cohesive design. It prevents classes from being tightly coupled to unnecessary methods and promotes better separation of concerns in your codebase.

In summary, the Interface Segregation Principle encourages the creation of fine-grained interfaces tailored to the specific needs of clients, promoting a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.

5) Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
This principle advocates using interfaces and dependency injection to decouple modules and make them more independent and interchangeable.

In simple words:
"Depend on abstractions, not on concretions."

This principle suggests that high-level modules (higher-level classes or components) should not depend directly on low-level modules (lower-level classes or components).
Instead, both high-level and low-level modules should depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes).

In other words:

i) High-level modules define what they need in terms of abstract interfaces or classes.
ii) Low-level modules implement those interfaces or classes.

By following the Dependency Inversion Principle, you achieve loose coupling between components, making your code more flexible and easier to maintain.
It also allows you to change the implementation of low-level modules without affecting the high-level modules, as long as the new implementation adheres to the same abstraction.

In summary, the Dependency Inversion Principle promotes the use of interfaces and abstractions to decouple components, making your codebase more resilient to changes and enabling easier substitution of implementations.

*****************************

By applying these SOLID principles, developers can create software that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
These principles are widely recognized and adopted in the software development community
and are essential guidelines for writing clean and scalable code.
