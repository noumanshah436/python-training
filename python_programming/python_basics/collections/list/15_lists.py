# list = used to store multiple items in a single variable
# A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or
#   changeable, ordered sequence of elements.
# Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item


# Lists in Python

lst = []  # list with no member, empty list
lst = [1, 2, 3]  # list of integers
lst = [1, 2.5, 3.7, 9]  # list of numbers (integers and floating point)
lst = ['a', 'b', 'c']  # list of characters
lst = ['a', 1, 'b', 3.5, 'zero']  # list of mixed value types
lst = ['One', 'Two', 'Three']  # list of strings

# print(food[0])

# food[0] = "sushi"   # update/change list value

#  Unpack a Collection
# If you have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you extract
# the values into variables. This is called unpacking.
