pip is a package-management system written in Python used to install and manage software packages (Modules).
 It connects to an online repository of public and paid-for private packages, called the Python Package Index.
 Most distributions of Python come with pip preinstalled.

PIP is a package manager for Python packages, or modules if you like. Note: If you have Python version 3.4 or later, PIP is included by default.
