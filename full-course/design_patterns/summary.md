Sure! Here‚Äôs a **simple explanation** of the most common **design patterns** in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), grouped by category:

## üé® 1. **Creational Patterns**

*How objects are created*

| Pattern              | Simple Explanation                                                                                       |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Singleton**        | Only one instance of a class is allowed (e.g., a single config manager).                                 |
| **Factory**          | A method that decides which class or object to create (like a constructor with logic).                   |
| **Abstract Factory** | A factory of related factories. Useful for creating families of related objects.                         |
| **Builder**          | Separates object construction from its representation. Useful for building complex objects step by step. |
| **Prototype**        | Clone existing objects instead of creating new ones from scratch.                                        |

## üîÑ 2. **Structural Patterns**

*How classes and objects are combined*

| Pattern       | Simple Explanation                                                                              |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Adapter**   | Converts one class's interface into another the client expects. Like a plug adapter.            |
| **Decorator** | Adds behavior to an object without changing its class. (e.g., wrapping a function for logging). |
| **Facade**    | Provides a simple interface to a complex system (like a one-stop-shop API).                     |
| **Proxy**     | Acts as a stand-in for another object. Useful for access control or lazy loading.               |
| **Bridge**    | Separates an object‚Äôs abstraction from its implementation. (e.g., UI themes and widgets).       |
| **Composite** | Treats groups of objects the same as individual ones. (e.g., folders and files).                |
| **Flyweight** | Reuses objects to save memory when many are similar (e.g., game tiles, characters).             |

## ü§ù 3. **Behavioral Patterns**

*How objects interact*

| Pattern                     | Simple Explanation                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Observer**                | When one object changes, others are notified. (e.g., event listeners or notifications). |
| **Strategy**                | Swap algorithms at runtime. (e.g., different sorting or payment methods).               |
| **Command**                 | Encapsulate a request as an object. Useful for undo/redo systems.                       |
| **State**                   | Change object behavior based on its state (e.g., a door that opens/closes).             |
| **Chain of Responsibility** | Pass a request through a chain until someone handles it. (e.g., middleware).            |
| **Template Method**         | Base class defines a skeleton; subclasses fill in the steps.                            |
| **Mediator**                | Central object controls communication between classes to reduce direct dependencies.    |
| **Iterator**                | Lets you loop over an object without exposing its internal structure.                   |
| **Visitor**                 | Add new behavior to a group of classes without changing them.                           |
