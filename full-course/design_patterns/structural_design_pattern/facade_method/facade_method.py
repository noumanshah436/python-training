# Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified (but limited) interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework.

# Facade Method is a Structural Design pattern that provides a simpler unified interface to a more complex system.
# The word Facade means the face of a building or particularly an outer lying interface of a complex system, consists of several sub-systems.

# It is an essential part Gang of Four design patterns.
# It provides an easier way to access methods of the underlying systems by providing a single entry point.

"""Facade pattern with an example of WashingMachine"""

class Washing:
	'''Subsystem # 1'''

	def wash(self):
		print("Washing...")


class Rinsing:
	'''Subsystem # 2'''

	def rinse(self):
		print("Rinsing...")


class Spinning:
	'''Subsystem # 3'''

	def spin(self):
		print("Spinning...")

	'''Facade'''

	def __init__(self):
		self.washing = Washing()
		self.rinsing = Rinsing()
		self.spinning = Spinning()

	def startWashing(self):
		self.washing.wash()
		self.rinsing.rinse()

# Advantages
# Isolation: We can easily isolate our code from the complexity of a subsystem.
# Testing Process: Using Facade Method makes the process of testing comparatively easy since it has convenient methods for common testing tasks.
# Loose Coupling: Availability of loose coupling between the clients and the Subsystems.

# Disadvantages
# Changes in Methods: As we know that in Facade method, subsequent methods are attached to Facade layer and any change in subsequent method may brings change in Facade layer which is not favorable.
# Costly process: It is not cheap to establish the Facade method in our application for the system’s reliability.
# Violation of rules: There is always the fear of violation of the construction of the facade layer.

# Applicability
# Providing simple Interface: One of the most important application of Facade Method is that it is used whenever you want to provide the simple interface to the complex sub-system
# Division into layers: It is used when we want to provide a unique structure to a sub-system by dividing them into layers. It also leads to loose coupling between the clients and the subsystem.
