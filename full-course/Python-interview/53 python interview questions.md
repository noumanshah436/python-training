### What type of language is Python?
Python is a general-purpose, object-oriented language. It is also an interpreted language.

### What are some features of the Python language?
- **Interpreted Language**: Python code does not need to compile before running.
- **Dynamically Typed**: No need to declare the type of variable when you create it.
- **Object-Oriented**: Define classes, use composition, and inheritance.
- **First-Class Functions**: Assign functions to variables, return them from other functions, or pass them as arguments.
- **General-Purpose**: Used in automation, web applications, machine learning, big data, etc.
- **Ease of Writing**: Quick and easy to write code, though it generally runs slower than compiled languages.

### What is PEP8?
PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8) is the official style guide for Python code, providing conventions and recommendations for writing clean, readable, and consistent Python code. It helps developers write code that is easier to read and maintain, making collaboration more efficient.

### What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
Lists are mutable (can be changed), whereas tuples are immutable (cannot be changed once created).

### How does Python manage memory?
Python manages memory in its private heap space, controlled by the memory manager and garbage collector.<br>
Python has a private heap space that stores all the objects. The Python memory manager regulates various aspects of this heap, such as sharing, caching, segmentation, and allocation. The user has no control over the heap; only the Python interpreter has access.

### What is a Python namespace?
Namespaces in Python ensure that variables, functions, and other names don’t clash by providing a scope within which names are unique.

### What is the purpose of the PYTHONPATH variable?
PYTHONPATH is an environmental variable that tells the operating system where to find Python libraries.

### What is the purpose of the PYTHONSTARTUP variable?
This variable contains the path of an initialization file with Python source code that executes each time the Python interpreter starts.

### What is the purpose of the PYTHONCASEOK variable?
In Windows, this variable tells the Python interpreter to use case-insensitive matches when finding imported libraries.

### What is the purpose of the PYTHONHOME variable?
This is an alternate path to search for Python modules.

### What are Python modules?
A Python module is a collection of Python classes, functions, and variables, often separated from each other to provide different functionality.

### What are some common modules in the Python standard library?
- **Email**: Parse, handle, and generate email messages.
- **String**: Types of strings, such as all capital or lowercase letters.
- **Sqlite3**: Deal with the SQLite database.
- **XML**: Provides XML support.
- **Logging**: Creates logging classes to log system details.
- **Traceback**: Allows extracting and printing stack trace details.

### What is scope in Python?
Scope is the block of code where a variable is accessible:
- **Local Scope**: Objects available in the current function.
- **Global Scope**: Objects available through the code execution since their inception.
- **Module-Level Scope**: Global objects of the current module accessible in the program.
- **Outermost Scope**: Contains built-in names callable in the program.

### How would you get a user’s home directory in Python?
```python
import os
home_directory = os.path.expanduser('~')
print(home_directory)
```

### What built-in types does Python support?
- **Integers**: Whole numbers like 1, 2, 3.
- **Floating Point Numbers**: Numbers with decimal points like 1.1, 1.2, 1.3.
- **Strings**: Collections of characters like ‘a’, ‘abc’.
- **Booleans**: True or false.
- **Tuples**: Collections of values separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses.
- **Lists**: Ordered collection of values.
- **Dictionaries**: Unordered collection of key-value pairs.
- **Sets**: Unordered collection of unique values.

### What is a Python decorator?
Decorators allow modification of functions or classes using other functions. They are often used to log, enforce access control and instrumentation, caching, and monitoring.

### What is pickling/unpickling in Python?
- **Pickling**: Serializing an object into a string representation that can be saved to a file.
- **Unpickling**: Reversing the process, converting the string representation back into the object.

### What is a negative index in Python?
Negative indices allow counting from the end of a list, tuple, or string in reverse.

### How are global and local variables defined in Python?
- **Global Variable**: Defined outside any function.
- **Local Variable**: Defined within a function.

### Describe a few ways to generate a random number in Python.
```python
import random
print(random.randint(0, 100))  # Random integer between 0 and 100
print(random.random())  # Random float between 0 and 1
```

### What is a Python dictionary?
Dictionaries store values as key-value pairs, accessed by keys, and enclosed in curly brackets.

### Is Python case sensitive?
Yes, Python is case-sensitive.

### What is the output of the following code?
```python
def f():
    return 42
print(f())
```
**Output**: `42`

### What is the output of the following code?
```python
x = 5
def add_one():
    x += 1
    return x
print(add_one())
```
**Output**: Error. Local variable 'x' referenced before assignment.

### What is the output of the following code?
```python
def f():
    return 1, 2, 3
print(f())
```
**Output**: `(1, 2, 3)`

### How would you get all the keys in a Python dictionary?
```python
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
keys = my_dict.keys()
print(keys)
```

### How would you get all the values in a Python dictionary?
```python
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
values = my_dict.values()
print(values)
```

### How do you convert a string to an integer in python?
```python
string = "123"
integer = int(string)
print(integer)
```

### How do you convert a string to a long in python?
In Python 3, integers are of arbitrary precision, effectively replacing the `long` type from Python 2. Therefore, you use `int()` for large integers.
```python
string = "12345678901234567890"
long_integer = int(string)
print(long_integer)
```

### How do you convert a string to a floating-point number in python?
```python
string = "123.45"
float_number = float(string)
print(float_number)
```

### How do you convert an object to a string in python?
```python
obj = 123
string = str(obj)
print(string)
```

### What does the ** operator do in Python?
The `**` operator raises a number to a power.
```python
print(2 ** 3)  # Output: 8
```

### What does the // operator do in Python?
The `//` operator performs floor division.
```python
print(7 // 2)  # Output: 3
```

### What does the Python is operator do?
The `is` operator checks if two variables point to the same object in memory.
```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
print(a is b)  # Output: True
```

### What does the Python not in operator do?
The `not in` operator checks if an element is not present in a collection.
```python
print(4 not in [1, 2, 3])  # Output: True
```

### What does the Python break statement do?
The `break` statement exits the nearest enclosing loop.
```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
```

### What does the Python continue statement do?
The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next one.
```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
```

### What does the Python pass statement do?
The `pass` statement is a null operation; it does nothing.
```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        pass
    print(i)
```

### What are Python dictionary and list comprehensions?
- **List Comprehensions**: Concise way to create lists.
- **Dictionary Comprehensions**: Concise way to create dictionaries.
```python
list_comprehension = [x for x in range(5)]
print(list_comprehension)

dict_comprehension = {x: x*2 for x in range(5)}
print(dict_comprehension)
```

### What are Python lambdas and why are they used?
Lambdas are anonymous functions created with the `lambda` keyword, often used for small, throwaway functions.
```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
```

### How do you copy an object in Python?
- **Shallow Copy**: `copy.copy()`
- **Deep Copy**: `copy.deepcopy()`
```python
import copy
original = [1, 2, [3, 4]]
shallow_copy = copy.copy(original)
deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(original)
```

### What is self in Python?
`self` represents the instance of the class and allows access to the attributes and methods of the class.

### What is __init__ in Python?
`__init__` is a special method in Python, acting as a constructor that initializes an object's attributes.
```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
```

### What is a generator in Python?
Generators are a simple way of creating iterators using `yield` to produce values lazily, one at a time, and thus they can be more memory efficient than lists.
```python
def generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

gen = generator()
for value in gen:
    print(value)
```

### What does the Python help() function do?
The `help()` function provides the help documentation for a module, function, class, or keyword.

### What does the Python dir() function do?
The `dir()` function returns a list of the attributes and methods of an object.

### What is the difference between .py and .pyc files?
- **.py**: Contains the source code of a program.
- **.pyc**: Contains the compiled bytecode, produced by the interpreter to be executed by the Python virtual machine.

### What is a docstring in Python?
A docstring is a string literal specified in source code used to document a specific segment of code, typically enclosed in triple quotes.

### Write Python code to print the complete contents of a file with error handling for missing files.
```python
try:
    with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
        contents = file.read()
        print(contents)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found")
```

### Write Python code to print the sum of all numbers from 25 to 75, inclusive.
```python
total_sum = sum(range(25, 76))
print(total_sum)
```

### Write Python code to print the length of each line in a particular file, not counting whitespace at the ends.
```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        print(len(line.strip()))
```

### Write Python code to remove the whitespace from the following string – ‘abc def geh ijk’.
```python
string = 'abc def geh ijk'
no_whitespace = string.replace(' ', '')
print(no_whitespace)
```

### Write Python code to remove duplicate items from a list.
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4]
unique_list = list(set(my_list))
print(unique_list)
```

### How are arguments passed by value or by reference in Python?

In Python, arguments are passed neither purely by value nor purely by reference. Instead, Python uses a mechanism often referred to as "pass-by-object-reference" or "pass-by-assignment."

Here's how it works:
1. **Immutable Objects (e.g., integers, strings, tuples)**: When an immutable object is passed to a function, a copy of the reference to the object is passed. However, since the object is immutable, any modifications to the parameter within the function will not affect the original object.

2. **Mutable Objects (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets)**: When a mutable object is passed to a function, a reference to the same object is passed. This means that changes made to the object within the function will affect the original object outside the function.

#### Examples

#### Immutable Object (Integer)
```python
def modify_immutable(x):
    x += 1
    print(f"Inside function: {x}")

a = 10
modify_immutable(a)
print(f"Outside function: {a}")
```
**Output**:
```
Inside function: 11
Outside function: 10
```
Explanation: The integer `a` remains unchanged outside the function because integers are immutable.

#### Mutable Object (List)
```python
def modify_mutable(lst):
    lst.append(4)
    print(f"Inside function: {lst}")

my_list = [1, 2, 3]
modify_mutable(my_list)
print(f"Outside function: {my_list}")
```
**Output**:
```
Inside function: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Outside function: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
Explanation: The list `my_list` is modified inside the function, and the change is reflected outside the function because lists are mutable.

#### Summary
- **Immutable objects**: Changes within the function do not affect the original object.
- **Mutable objects**: Changes within the function affect the original object.
