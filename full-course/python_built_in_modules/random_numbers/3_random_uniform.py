# The `random.uniform` method in Python is used to generate a random floating-point number within a specified range.

# ### **Syntax:**
# ```python
# random.uniform(a, b)
# ```
# ### **Parameters:**
# - `a` (float) – The lower bound of the range.
# - `b` (float) – The upper bound of the range.

# ### **Returns:**
# A random floating-point number `N` such that:
# a <= N <= b


# (Note: If `a > b`, it still works as `random.uniform` swaps them internally.)

# ### **Example Usage:**
# ```python
import random

# Generate a random float between 1.5 and 5.5
random_number = random.uniform(1.5, 5.5)
print(random_number)
# ```

# ### **Key Points:**
# - It includes both the lower and upper bounds.
# - Useful for simulations, random sampling, and probabilistic modeling.
# - Works with negative numbers as well.
