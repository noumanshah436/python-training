# task group is a slightly more preferred way to create multiple tasks and organize them together. The reason for
# this is that it provides built-in error handling.

# If any of the tasks inside the task group fail, it will automatically cancel all the other tasks, which is ypically
#    preferable when dealing with advanced errors or larger applications where we want to be more robust.

# **************************************

# for i, sleep_time in enumerate([2, 1, 3], start=1):
#   print(f"i: {i},  sleep_time:{sleep_time}")

# i: 1,   sleep_time:2
# i: 2,   sleep_time:1
# i: 3,   sleep_time:3

# **************************************

# The task group approach is cleaner and automatically executes all tasks within the group.
# Once all tasks are complete, it stops blocking, allowing the program to continue to the next line of code.
# At that point, the results from the tasks can be retrieved.
