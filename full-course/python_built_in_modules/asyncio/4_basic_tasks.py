# Task is a way to schedule a coroutine to run as soon as possible,
#   and allow us to run multiple coroutines simultaneously.

# **************************************************************

# The issue we saw previously is that, we need to wait for one coroutine to finish before we could execute the next.

# With task we don't have that issue.
# When a coroutine is paused or idle, the program switches to another task, optimizing efficiency by always doing work instead of waiting.
# Here we are not using multiple CPU cores, we are just switching from one idle task to start working on another task.

# The whole goal here is that our program is optimizing its efficiency, so we're always attempting to do something. 
#   And when we're waiting on something that's not in control of our program, we switch over to another task.
