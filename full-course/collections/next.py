### Simple Example of `next()` with a Condition

# Let's create a simple example using a list of dictionaries representing actors, 
# and we want to find an actor based on a specific condition.

# List of actors represented as dictionaries
actors = [
    {'id': 1, 'name': 'Alice'},
    {'id': 2, 'name': 'Bob'},
    {'id': 3, 'name': 'Charlie'}
]

# Define the actor ID to search for
actor_id_to_find = 2

# Use next() to find the first actor with the specified ID, or None if not found
actor = next((actor for actor in actors if actor['id'] == actor_id_to_find), None)

# Output the result
print(actor)  # Output: {'id': 2, 'name': 'Bob'}


### Explanation
# 1. **Generator Expression**: `(actor for actor in actors if actor['id'] == actor_id_to_find)`
#    - This generator iterates through the `actors` list and yields each `actor` whose `'id'` matches `actor_id_to_find`.
   
# 2. **`next()` Function**:
#    - Retrieves the first item from the generator.
#    - If no item matches the condition, it returns `None`.
