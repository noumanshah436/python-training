# Python is single threaded or multhreaded?



Python supports **multithreading**, but the reality is a bit nuanced depending on what you’re trying to achieve. Here's the breakdown:

---

## ✅ Python **Can** Use Multithreading

* You can **create and run multiple threads** using the `threading` module.
* This is useful for **I/O-bound** tasks (like network calls, file I/O, or database access).

### Example:

```python
import threading

def say_hello():
    print("Hello from thread")

thread = threading.Thread(target=say_hello)
thread.start()
thread.join()
```

---

## ❌ But Python Has the **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**

* The **GIL** is a mutex in CPython (the standard Python implementation).
* It allows **only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time**, even if you have multiple CPU cores.
* So, for **CPU-bound tasks** (like math, number crunching), threads **won’t run truly in parallel**.

---

## ✅ For True Parallelism: Use Multiprocessing

* If you need **parallel execution** of CPU-heavy tasks, use the `multiprocessing` module.
* It creates **separate processes**, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space — bypassing the GIL.

## ✅ Summary

| Feature          | Threading                     | Multiprocessing               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Real parallelism | ❌ (due to GIL, for CPU tasks) | ✅ (separate processes)        |
| Best for         | I/O-bound tasks               | CPU-bound tasks               |
| Shares memory    | ✅ (same process)              | ❌ (separate memory spaces)    |
| Overhead         | Low                           | Higher (due to process start) |
| Uses GIL         | Yes                           | No                            |

So, to answer your question:

> **Is Python single-threaded or multithreaded?**

✅ Python is **multithreaded**, but due to the **GIL**, only one thread can execute Python code at a time — limiting true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks.
